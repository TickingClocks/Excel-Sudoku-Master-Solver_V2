# Excel-Sudoku-Master-Solver_V2
This Excel spreadsheet will solve any valid sudoku puzzle. 

I created this spreadsheet so that I could visually see my algorithm solve any sudoku puzzle.

This project is intended to be visual NOT fast. Running through an expert-level sudoku puzzle is satisfying at normal speed, donâ€™t use SLO-MO on a difficult puzzle or it will take quite some time to solve.

The SLO-MO feature can be used to slow the code down so you can see how the algorithm works. The SLO-MO value (milliseconds) is placed in cell "O11". SLO-MO mode is toggled with the SLO-MO button.

I may add features to the spreadsheet in the future.
